The code should be written in Python. The API should be protected with an authentication layer. Authorization should be open to all authenticated users.

Outcome: Document the exercise (code, config files, README) in a GitHub (or similar) repository and share it with us at least one day before the demo.

Bonus: Automate the setup as much as possible using AWS serverless services.
